# Abstract Transition Systems

An implementation of several classic transition systems that describe
algorithms for SAT or SMT. The purpose is to make it very easy to experiment
with new calculi or variants of existing calculi.

- Calculi
  * [x] DPLL
  * [ ] CDCL
  * [ ] mcsat '13
  * [ ] mcsat '17 (with non boolean propagations)
  â€¦
- Interfaces
  * [x] linenoise
  * [ ] interactive web UI
